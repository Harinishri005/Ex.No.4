## **2. Comparative Analysis Prompt**

### **Prompt Generation**

* *Example 1:* “Compare the economic policies of India and China in terms of industrial growth, foreign investment, and technological advancement.”
* *Example 2:* “Compare the advantages and disadvantages of renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) in addressing climate change.”

### **Evaluation**

Comparative Analysis prompts encourage the model to engage in critical thinking by highlighting **similarities and differences**. These prompts are particularly useful for academic contexts, debates, or research discussions.

* **Strengths:**

  * Encourages structured analysis.
  * Produces multi-dimensional perspectives.
  * Useful for decision-making and policy discussions.

* **Limitations:**

  * May lead to biased responses if the model is influenced by data imbalance.
  * Requires precise framing to avoid vague comparisons.

**Verdict:** Highly effective for tasks requiring structured comparisons, but must be framed with **clear parameters**.

## **3. Experiential Perspective Prompt**

### **Prompt Generation**

* *Example 1:* “Describe the challenges faced during your first day at university from a student’s perspective.”
* *Example 2:* “Imagine you are a nurse in an emergency ward. Share your experience of managing patients during a critical situation.”

### **Evaluation**

Experiential Perspective prompts place the model in a **first-person or role-based viewpoint**, enhancing **empathy and relatability**.

* **Strengths:**

  * Generates vivid, story-like responses.
  * Creates human-centered narratives.
  * Effective in simulations, role-playing, and scenario-based learning.

* **Limitations:**

  * Responses may lack authenticity if the model is not trained deeply on similar experiences.
  * Risk of generating generalized stereotypes instead of nuanced perspectives.

**Verdict:** Strong for **storytelling and role-play**, but requires careful validation in professional or sensitive contexts.



## **4. Everyday Functioning Prompts**

### **Prompt Generation**

* *Example 1:* “List five healthy breakfast options that can be prepared in under 10 minutes.”
* *Example 2:* “How can I organize my daily schedule to balance study, exercise, and social activities?”

### **Evaluation**

Everyday Functioning prompts focus on **practical life solutions**, making AI more accessible in **day-to-day living**.

* **Strengths:**

  * Provides actionable suggestions.
  * Highly relatable to users.
  * Enhances AI’s utility in lifestyle, productivity, and well-being.

* **Limitations:**

  * May oversimplify complex real-world issues.
  * Lacks adaptability for very specific personal conditions.

**Verdict:** Excellent for **lifestyle guidance and problem-solving**, though personalization is limited.



## **5. Universal Prompt Structures**

### **Prompt Generation**

* *Example 1:* “Summarize the key points of this article in three bullet points.”
* *Example 2:* “Generate five interview questions with answers for a software engineering role.”
* *Example 3:* “Translate this paragraph into French.”

### **Evaluation**

Universal prompt structures are **template-based** and widely applicable across multiple domains. They often include **command verbs** like *summarize, generate, translate, compare, list*.

* **Strengths:**

  * Standardized and reusable.
  * Suitable for both beginners and advanced users.
  * Easy for AI to process due to clear instructions.

* **Limitations:**

  * May reduce creativity if overused.
  * Outputs risk becoming formulaic.

**Verdict:** Reliable and versatile, but should be combined with **creative variations** to enhance outcomes.

## **6. Prompt Refinements and Size Limitations**

### **Prompt Generation**

* *Initial Prompt:* “Explain AI.”
* *Refined Prompt:* “Explain Artificial Intelligence in simple terms, focusing on how it is used in smartphones, healthcare, and education, within 200 words.”

### **Evaluation**

Refinement improves clarity and ensures **focused responses**. However, **size limitations** also play a key role: overly long prompts may confuse the model, while overly short prompts may lack context.

* **Strengths of Refinement:**

  * Improves precision and relevance.
  * Allows control over output size, tone, and complexity.

* **Challenges with Size:**

  * Too short → vague, generic answers.
  * Too long → risk of misinterpretation or losing focus.

**Verdict:** Prompt refinement is critical for **professional and academic contexts**. Optimal prompt size should balance **context richness with clarity**.

## **7. Comparative Evaluation of All Prompt Types**

| **Prompt Type**               | **Best Use Case**                                 | **Strengths**                              | **Limitations**                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Comparative Analysis          | Research, debates, policy evaluation              | Structured insights, multiple perspectives | Risk of bias if poorly framed               |
| Experiential Perspective      | Storytelling, simulations, empathy-based learning | Relatable, human-centered                  | May lack authenticity in sensitive contexts |
| Everyday Functioning          | Lifestyle, productivity, decision-making          | Actionable, practical                      | Limited personalization                     |
| Universal Prompt Structures   | Academic, general use, translation                | Standardized, reusable                     | Can become repetitive                       |
| Refinement & Size Limitations | Academic, professional, technical writing         | Precision, focus, concise results          | Size imbalance affects quality              |
